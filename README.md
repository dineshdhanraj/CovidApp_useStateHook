# CovidApp using Use State Hook

I have developed a COVID-19 application that enables users to enter a country name and retrieve relevant statistics such as the number of patients, recoveries, and other details. 

This application has been designed using the latest industry-standard techniques and features advanced programming concepts, including the use of the useState hook to update values. The app is user-friendly and has been tested extensively to ensure its reliability and accuracy.
